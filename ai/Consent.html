You are being asked to participate in a research study. The purpose of the study is to examine how individuals acting as supply chain managers view the forecast results provided by a decision support system.  Taking part in this study is voluntary, and choosing not to take part will not affect your standing in any employment, class or other. The investigators will explain the study to you and will answer any questions you might have. It is your choice whether or not you take part in this study. If you agree to participate and then choose to withdraw from the study, that is your right, and your decision will not be held against you. </p>

<p>
Your participation in this research study involves indicating whether you accept the predictions provided by a decision support system. The questions will be presented in an online experiment. This is a one-time activity and there will be no direct interaction with the investigators or with other participants. The experiment involves questions such as “Week 34 forecast value: 377 units. Will you keep it?” and will take you approximately 30 minutes.

<p>
This research study is not expected to pose any additional risks beyond what you would normally experience in your regular everyday life. However, the possible risks specific to this research study include those similar to a person’s everyday use of the Internet. Study data will be physically and electronically secured by the research team. As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security. The research team will store your personal information in a separate and secure location away from your study data and maintain your confidentiality in all publications/presentations to do with this research. Access to research study records will be limited to people who have a need to review this information. All paper and electronic data collected from this study will be stored in a secure location on the UNT campus and/or a secure UNT server for at least three (3) years past the end of this research in a password protected computer in PI’s campus office.

Every participant will receive a base compensation of $3, plus a variable payment based on their performance. The top 25% will receive a bonus payment of $3; the next 25% will receive a bonus payment of $2; the next 25% will receive a bonus payment of $1; the final quartile will not receive any bonus payment. In essence, you will receive compensation anywhere between $3 and $6 based on your performance. Bonus payments will be processed after all participants have completed the survey.
